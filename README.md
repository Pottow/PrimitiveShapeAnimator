# Primitve Shape Animator

A prototype tool for manipulating objects in 3D space, to be used for CAD and environment modelling. The aim of this project was to design a better user feel than other 3D software, such as Unity or Blender, by giving the user more intuitive control over objects in the 3D space. 

Rather than moving objects relative to an arbitrary world axis, you inhabit the objects directly and move them using standard WASD controls relative to the camera. You can change between move/rotate/scale modes using keyboard shortcuts.

#Limitations:

Curently there is no saving or export mechanic in place. At the moment this prototype only works as a 3D visualisation tool.

#Controls:

W - move forward  
A - move left
